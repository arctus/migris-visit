# migris-visit
A small helper application to help order a visit in MIGRIS (Migration system of Lithuania). Normally all the visits in Vilnius are booked out for the next 10 days, however from time to time some visists appear again (as people are rescheduling their visists do you change in their plans) and the application books desired time and date.
